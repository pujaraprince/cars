<h1>About MyCARS </h1>
<p>Welcome to MyCARS - India's largest auto media vehicle. MyCARS has always striven to serve car buyers and owners in the most comprehensive and convenient way possible. We provide a platform where car buyers and owners can research, buy, sell and come together to discuss and talk about their cars.</p>
<h2>A Brief History:</h2>
<p>MyCARS was launched in October 2005 by Mohit, Gaurav, Tufail and Arun. Since then we have been credited with several initiatives for Indian car consumers.
In 2005, we became the first website in India to consolidate used car inventory across dealers and present it to car buyers as an online marketplace.
In 2006, we launched India’s first Used Car Price Guide. For the first time, a used car buyer or seller could see what was the actual market value of their vehicle, depending on the car’s model, variant, age, condition, mileage, city and whether they were transacting with a dealer or an individual. Today, CarWale’s Used Car Price Guide stands as India’s most comprehensive and credible source of information on used car prices. We offer prices for all the popular cars sold in India since 1991 across 28 cities.</p>
<h2>Awards:</h2>
<p>Along the way, we have been recognised for a few achievements.
Red Herring Global 200 (2010) – We were recognised as one of the world’s top 200 innovative IT companies by Red Herring.
Red Herring Asia 100 (2009 and 2007) – We were recognised as one of Asia’s top 100 innovative IT companies in both 2007 and 2009</p>
